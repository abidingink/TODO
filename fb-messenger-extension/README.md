# Facebook Messenger @fred Bot - Browser Extension

This extension watches for @fred mentions in Facebook Messenger and sends them to Moltbot for responses.

## Installation Instructions (No Coding Required!)

1. **Download the extension files** from the release package
2. **Extract the ZIP file** to a folder on your computer
3. **Open Chrome** and go to: `chrome://extensions`
4. **Enable Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)
5. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the extracted folder
6. **Pin the extension** (click the puzzle piece icon, then pin @fred Bot)

## Setup

1. **Sign into Facebook Messenger** in your browser
2. **Click the extension icon** and enter your Moltbot details:
   - Gateway URL: (provided separately)
   - Session Key: (provided separately)
3. **Enable the bot** for specific chats by clicking "Enable @fred responses" in each conversation

## How It Works

- The extension quietly watches for @fred mentions in Messenger
- When mentioned, it sends the message context to Moltbot
- After a short delay (like a human typing), it inserts the response
- Only responds when you explicitly enable it for each chat

## Safety Features

- ✅ Only works on chats YOU enable it for
- ✅ Adds human-like delays before responding
- ✅ Simulates typing indicator
- ✅ Won't respond to every message - only @mentions
- ✅ You can disable it anytime

## Troubleshooting

If Facebook shows warnings:
1. Disable the extension temporarily
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Re-enable it slowly - don't spam messages

Remember: This is a prototype. Use responsibly and don't overuse it!
